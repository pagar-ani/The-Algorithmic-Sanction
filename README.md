# The Algorithmic Sanction: Countering Artificial Intelligence (AI) Driven Economic Warfare

This repository hosts the working paper of an independent policy brief that examines a framework to create a sovereign, AI-enabled geo-economic intelligence system. It is a personal research project intended to add to the public discourse discussion on AI, geopolitics, and national security.

## Document Status: Working Paper

Please note that this document is a working paper. It is being shared publicly on this platform to showcase research and analytical capabilities, receive feedback and stimulate discussion. The conclusions and content are subject to revision. I intend to submit this work for formal peer-reviewed publication in the future.

## Summary

*   **The Problem:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses a dual threat. It facilitates attacks by adversaries to levy hyper-precise algorithmic sanctions as well as offers advanced infrastructure to circumvent ordinary countermeasures and renders conventional economic defenses outdated.

*   **The Core Argument:** In the digital era, a country needs to build its own sovereign AI-based geo-economic intelligence in order to ensure economic security and strategically remain independent. Depending on solutions off-the-shelf or foreign solutions is a strategic weakness.

*   **The Proposed Solution:** The brief recommends establishing a **National Geo-Economic Intelligence Centre (NGEIC)**. This would serve as a public-private sandbox, where state-of-the-art AI, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), would be used to map and mitigate national economic risks on anonymized commercial data in a “data-never-leaves” privacy-preserving architecture.

> The central thesis is that classic economic defenses are obsolete against AI-driven threats. This brief presents a technically plausible and strategically necessary course toward the building a sovereign analytical capacity of the digital age.

## Read the Full Brief

The paper offers a thorough analysis of the threat model, the technical architecture for the proposed solution, a robust governance and oversight framework, and a discussion of the main implementation issues.
